## Diabetes Prediction
Machine learning as a tool for early diabetes detection: By delving into complex medical data, machine learning algorithms might empower us to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes before it's too late.

## About Project
1. Using data to predict diabetes: This project aims to develop a tool that can analyze various medical factors like age, blood sugar, and BMI to determine if someone is likely to have diabetes.
2. Uncovering patterns in medical data: We're building a model to automatically classify individuals as having diabetes or not based on information like blood pressure, weight, and family history.
3. Machine learning for diabetes diagnosis: This project explores whether analyzing data points such as glucose levels and body mass index can help predict the presence of diabetes.
4. Classifying diabetes risk: Our goal is to create a system that uses medical information like age and insulin levels to assess an individual's risk of developing diabetes.
5. Predicting diabetes with medical data: This project investigates the potential of using factors like blood pressure and family history to identify individuals at risk of diabetes through a machine learning model.

## About Dataset
The dataset includes various health factors like the number of pregnancies, blood sugar levels after a glucose test, and family history, to predict the presence of diabetes (0 meaning no diabetes, 1 meaning diabetes).
We're looking at features like past pregnancies, blood pressure, and body mass index, along with genetic factors, to see if they can help identify individuals with diabetes (labeled as 0 or 1).

1. Pregnancies : Number of times woman has been pregnant
2. Glucose : Plasma Glucose Concentration of two hours in an oral glucose
3. Blood Pressure : Diastollic Blood Pressure (in mmhg)
4. Skin Thickness Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (in mm)
5. Insulin : two hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body Mass Index : in (weight in kg/height in m)^2
7. Age : (Years)
8. Diabetes Pedigree Function : Scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
9. Outcome : 1 (has diabetes) and 0 (does not has diabetes)
